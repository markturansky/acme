# Observability Requirements for Multi-Cluster GitOps

## Overview

This document outlines observability features needed to improve operational efficiency for sysadmins managing the OpenShift Bootstrap multi-cluster environment. These requirements focus on actionable insights, automated troubleshooting, and simplified daily operations.

## 1. Cluster Lifecycle Visibility

### CAPI Provisioning Dashboard
Real-time visibility into cluster provisioning progress with detailed status information.

**Requirements:**
- Visual progress bars for cluster provisioning stages
- Estimated time to completion (ETA) for each phase
- Stuck/failed provisioning detection with root cause analysis
- Historical provisioning metrics (success rate, average time)

**Example Interface:**
```
┌─ Cluster Provisioning Status ────────────────┐
│ cluster-44 [████████░░] 80% - Installing CNI │
│ cluster-45 [██████████] ✓   - Ready          │ 
│ cluster-46 [███░░░░░░░] 30% - Creating VPC   │
│                                              │
│ ⚠️  cluster-43: Stuck for 15m - Node quota   │
│ ❌ cluster-42: Failed - Invalid subnet       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Real-time Cluster Health Matrix
Single-pane view of all clusters with essential health metrics.

**Requirements:**
- `kubectl get clusters` equivalent with health status
- Node count vs. desired state
- Age and instance type information
- Health status with color coding (Ready/Degraded/Pending/Failed)

**Example Command:**
```bash
kubectl get clusters --all-namespaces -o wide
# us-west-2/cluster-41    Ready   3/3 nodes   5d   m5.large
# ap-se-1/cluster-42      Degraded 2/3 nodes  2d   m5.xlarge
# us-west-2/cluster-43    Pending  0/3 nodes  10m  m5.xlarge
```

## 2. GitOps Operations Dashboard

### ArgoCD Multi-Cluster Status
Centralized view of GitOps application health across all regional clusters.

**Requirements:**
- Visual drift detection between desired and actual state
- Failed sync alerts with root cause analysis
- Configuration validation before applying changes
- Automatic rollback triggers based on health check failures
- Sync history and rollback capabilities

### Application Health Heatmap
Matrix view showing application status across all clusters and regions.

**Example Interface:**
```
Region        Cluster-41  Cluster-42  Cluster-43
monitoring    ✓ Healthy   ⚠️ Degraded  ❌ Failed
networking    ✓ Healthy   ✓ Healthy    🔄 Syncing  
storage       ✓ Healthy   ✓ Healthy    ⏸️ Paused
```

**Requirements:**
- Real-time status updates
- Drill-down capability to see detailed errors
- Historical trends for application health
- Alerting on application degradation

## 3. Resource and Performance Monitoring

### Cross-Cluster Resource Dashboard
Unified view of resource utilization across all clusters.

**Requirements:**
- CPU/Memory utilization trends per region and cluster
- Node capacity planning with predictive alerts
- Pod scheduling failure tracking and analysis
- Cost tracking and attribution per cluster/region
- Resource quota monitoring and alerts

### Network Health Monitoring
Comprehensive network connectivity and performance monitoring.

**Requirements:**
- Hub-to-regional cluster connectivity monitoring
- Inter-cluster communication latency metrics
- Certificate expiration warnings (60/30/7 day alerts)
- DNS resolution issue detection and alerting
- Network policy violation monitoring

## 4. Configuration Management

### Converter Tool Integration
Enhanced tooling for regional specification validation and management.

**Requirements:**
- Batch validation of all regional specifications
- Configuration drift detection between specs and actual state
- Dry-run capabilities with diff output
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# Validate all regional specifications
./bin/validate-regions --check-all
# ✓ regions/us-west-2/eks-stage/region.yaml
# ⚠️ regions/ap-se-1/eks-prod/region.yaml - Missing compute.scaling
# ❌ regions/eu-west-1/ocp-dev/region.yaml - Invalid instance type

# Generate and diff before applying
./bin/generate-cluster --dry-run --diff regions/us-west-2/eks-stage/
```

### Configuration Drift Detection
Automated detection and alerting for configuration changes outside GitOps.

**Requirements:**
- Real-time comparison of actual vs. desired state
- Alert on manual changes made outside GitOps workflow
- Configuration lineage tracking (who changed what when)
- Automatic remediation options for common drift scenarios

## 5. Troubleshooting and Alerting

### Centralized Logging with Context
Unified logging interface with intelligent correlation capabilities.

**Requirements:**
- Cross-cluster log aggregation and search
- Automatic log correlation between hub and regional events
- Context-aware filtering (by application, cluster, time range)
- Log analytics for pattern detection

**Example Interface:**
```bash
# Single query across all clusters
kubectl logs --context=all-clusters -l app=my-service --since=1h
```

### Smart Alerting Rules
Intelligent alerting system with predefined operational thresholds.

**Required Alert Types:**
- Cluster provisioning stuck > 30 minutes
- GitOps sync failures > 3 attempts
- Regional cluster unreachable > 5 minutes
- Node NotReady > 2 minutes
- High error rate spikes (>5% increase)
- Resource exhaustion warnings (80% CPU/Memory)
- Certificate expiration alerts
- Security policy violations

**Alert Features:**
- Escalation workflows (Slack → PagerDuty → Auto-remediation)
- Alert correlation to reduce noise
- Runbook integration for common issues

## 6. Operational Workflows

### One-Command Health Checks
Simplified daily operational routines.

**Requirements:**
- Single command for overall system health
- Summary format with actionable recommendations

**Example Interface:**
```bash
# Daily morning routine
./bin/cluster-health-check --summary
# Overall: 2 healthy, 1 degraded, 0 failed
# Action required: cluster-42 needs node replacement
# Next: cluster-44 provisioning ETA 15m
```

### Automated Runbooks
Self-healing capabilities and automated remediation workflows.

**Requirements:**
- Automated response to common issues (restart failed pods, drain nodes)
- Escalation workflows with human intervention points
- Maintenance mode automation (drain, patch, uncordon)
- Rollback automation for failed deployments
- Integration with change management systems

## 7. Security and Compliance

## 10. Success Metrics

### Operational Efficiency
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) < 5 minutes
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) < 30 minutes
- Reduction in manual troubleshooting time by 70%
- Increase in automated issue resolution by 50%

### System Reliability
- 99.9% cluster availability
- <1% false positive alert rate

- Zero unplanned configuration drift

The key principle is providing **actionable insights** rather than just metrics - tell operators what's broken, why it's broken, and ideally how to fix it automatically.
