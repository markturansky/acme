# Installation Health Check & Fix Plan - EXECUTION LOG

**Date**: 2025-07-19  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All critical issues resolved

## Execution Progress

### Phase 1: Vault Authentication - IN PROGRESS
*Started: 2025-07-19 16:45*

**Thinking**: Need to configure Vault Kubernetes authentication. First let me check current Vault auth methods and state before making changes.

**Step 1.1**: Check existing auth methods - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Kubernetes auth already enabled at `kubernetes/` path
- Role `cluster-role` exists and configured correctly
- Policy `cluster-secrets` exists and has correct permissions

**DISCOVERY**: Issue is not missing Vault configuration - all Vault components are correct!

**ACTUAL ISSUE**: ServiceAccount `vault-secret-reader` has no token secret in modern Kubernetes
- ClusterSecretStore tries to authenticate but ServiceAccount has no token
- Need to create explicit token secret for ServiceAccount

**Step 1.2**: Create ServiceAccount token secret - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Created vault-secret-reader-token secret
- Token properly references vault-secret-reader ServiceAccount

**DEEPER ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Authentication still fails with 403 permission denied
- JWT token is correct: `system:serviceaccount:vault:vault-secret-reader`
- Role and policy configuration is correct
- Issue may be stale Kubernetes auth configuration

**Step 1.3**: Reconfigure Kubernetes auth method - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Reconfigured auth/kubernetes/config with fresh CA cert and JWT token
- Manual authentication test successful  
- Recreated ClusterSecretStore to refresh cache
- **RESULT**: ClusterSecretStore status: Valid, Ready=True

### Phase 1: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
*Completed: 2025-07-19 17:15*

All Vault authentication issues resolved! ESO can now authenticate to Vault successfully.

### Phase 2: HCP ExternalSecrets - IN PROGRESS  
*Started: 2025-07-19 17:15*

**Thinking**: Now that ESO can connect to Vault, I need to ensure HCP cluster has ExternalSecrets configuration to pull secrets.

**Step 2.1**: Check if HCP cluster has external-secrets.yaml - ‚ùå MISSING
- HCP cluster missing external-secrets.yaml file
- HCP kustomization.yaml missing external-secrets.yaml reference
- Root cause: generate-cluster script updated but existing cluster not regenerated

**Step 2.2**: Create HCP ExternalSecrets configuration - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- Created clusters/hcp-01-mturansk-test/external-secrets.yaml
- Added external-secrets.yaml to kustomization.yaml resources
- Applied updated configuration
- **RESULT**: ExternalSecret Status=SecretSynced, Ready=True
- **RESULT**: pull-secret created in hcp-01-mturansk-test namespace

### Phase 2: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
*Completed: 2025-07-19 17:25*

HCP cluster now has working ExternalSecret configuration! Pull-secret is available for HostedCluster.

### Phase 3: Verification - IN PROGRESS
*Started: 2025-07-19 17:25*

**Step 3.1**: Check secret sync across all cluster namespaces - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- HCP cluster: ExternalSecret Status=SecretSynced, Ready=True ‚úÖ
- EKS cluster: Both aws-credentials and pull-secret Status=SecretSynced, Ready=True ‚úÖ  
- OCP cluster: Both aws-credentials and pull-secret Status=SecretSynced, Ready=True ‚úÖ
- **RESULT**: All ExternalSecrets working perfectly across all clusters!

**Step 3.2**: Monitor HCP HostedCluster progress - üü° IN PROGRESS
- HCP HostedCluster Status: PROGRESS=Partial, AVAILABLE=False  
- Current state: "Waiting for Kube APIServer deployment to become available"
- **NOTE**: This is expected - HCP cluster provisioning takes time, now has pull-secret to proceed

**Step 3.3**: Verify ClusterSecretStore health - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ClusterSecretStore Status: Ready=True, reason=Valid, message="store validated" ‚úÖ

### Phase 3: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
*Completed: 2025-07-19 17:35*

All secret synchronization working perfectly! ESO successfully pulling secrets from Vault for all clusters.

## üéâ INSTALLATION HEALTH CHECK: SUCCESS

### Summary of Fixes Applied:
1. **Fixed Vault Authentication**: Created ServiceAccount token secret and reconfigured Vault auth
2. **Fixed HCP ExternalSecrets**: Added missing external-secrets.yaml configuration 
3. **Verified All Components**: All ExternalSecrets syncing, ClusterSecretStore healthy

### Current Status:
- **Vault Integration**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly 
- **External Secrets Operator**: ‚úÖ All clusters have working secret sync
- **HCP Cluster**: üü° Provisioning (has pull-secret, progressing normally)
- **EKS Cluster**: ‚úÖ Ready with all secrets synced
- **OCP Cluster**: ‚úÖ Ready with all secrets synced

### Next Steps (Optional):
- Monitor HCP cluster provisioning progress (currently waiting for Kube APIServer)
- HCP cluster now has pull-secret and should complete provisioning normally

## üõ†Ô∏è GENERATOR FIXES APPLIED

### Phase 4: Generator ExternalSecrets Fix - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
*Started: 2025-07-19 17:35*

**Thinking**: User asked about generators - need to ensure all cluster types generate ExternalSecrets properly.

**Analysis Results**:
- ‚úÖ **HCP Generator**: Already generates ExternalSecrets correctly (lines 268-289)
- ‚úÖ **OCP Generator**: Uses base templates which include external-secrets.yaml  
- ‚ùå **EKS Generator**: MISSING ExternalSecrets generation

**Step 4.1**: Fix EKS generator to include ExternalSecrets - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Added ExternalSecret generation for aws-credentials and pull-secret
- Updated kustomization.yaml to include external-secrets.yaml  
- Tested with test cluster generation - working perfectly

**Step 4.2**: Test all generator types - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- EKS: ‚úÖ Now generates external-secrets.yaml correctly
- HCP: ‚úÖ Still generates external-secrets.yaml correctly  
- OCP: ‚úÖ Still uses base external-secrets.yaml correctly

### Summary of Generator Status:
- **EKS clusters**: ‚úÖ NEW clusters will now get ExternalSecrets automatically
- **HCP clusters**: ‚úÖ Already working, ExternalSecrets generated correctly
- **OCP clusters**: ‚úÖ Already working, uses base template ExternalSecrets

**Result**: All new clusters generated with bin/generate-cluster will now have proper ExternalSecrets configuration for Vault integration!

## üîç PHASE 5: CLUSTER PROVISIONING STATUS

### Phase 5: Cluster Provisioning & GitOps Health - IN PROGRESS
*Started: 2025-07-19 17:40*

**Step 5.1**: Check cluster provisioning status - üü° IN PROGRESS
- **HCP Cluster**: ‚úÖ AVAILABLE and JOINED to ACM Hub
  - Status: PROGRESS=Partial, AVAILABLE=True, PROGRESSING=False
  - Control plane: Available and functional
  - ManagedCluster: HUB ACCEPTED=true, JOINED=True, AVAILABLE=True ‚úÖ
- **EKS Cluster**: üü° PROVISIONED but not joined
  - CAPI Cluster: PHASE=Provisioned ‚úÖ  
  - ManagedCluster: HUB ACCEPTED=true, JOINED=False, AVAILABLE=Unknown
- **OCP Cluster**: üü° INITIALIZING
  - ClusterDeployment: PROVISIONSTATUS=Initialized
  - ManagedCluster: HUB ACCEPTED=true, JOINED=False, AVAILABLE=Unknown

**Step 5.2**: Check GitOps ApplicationSets - ‚ùå EXPECTED ISSUE
- ApplicationSets created but cannot connect to cluster endpoints yet
- Error: "unable to find destination server" - this is expected during provisioning
- ApplicationSets will sync once clusters provide their actual API endpoints

**Thinking**: Cluster provisioning takes time. HCP is fastest (already available), EKS/OCP still initializing. GitOps errors are expected until clusters expose their API servers to ArgoCD.

**Step 5.3**: Check cluster agent registration - ‚úÖ EXPECTED PROGRESS
- HCP KlusterletAddonConfig: Status shows "cluster is not provisioned by ACM" (normal during bootstrap)
- EKS/OCP: KlusterletAddonConfigs created, waiting for cluster agents to become active
- ArgoCD cluster registration: Pending until managed clusters complete provisioning

### Phase 5: COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
*Completed: 2025-07-19 17:45*

**Overall Status**: All critical infrastructure working. Cluster provisioning progressing normally.

## üèÅ FINAL TEST PLAN STATUS

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
1. **Vault Authentication**: ESO ‚Üí Vault integration fully operational
2. **ExternalSecrets Sync**: All cluster namespaces have working secret sync  
3. **Generator Fixes**: All cluster types now generate ExternalSecrets correctly
4. **Cluster Provisioning**: HCP available, EKS/OCP initializing as expected
5. **GitOps Framework**: ApplicationSets created, will sync when clusters register

### üü° IN PROGRESS (EXPECTED)  
- **EKS Cluster**: CAPI provisioned, waiting for ACM agent
- **OCP Cluster**: Hive initializing cluster deployment  
- **GitOps Applications**: Waiting for cluster endpoints to register with ArgoCD

### üìã NEXT MONITORING STEPS
1. Monitor cluster provisioning completion (15-45 minutes typical)
2. Verify ACM agent registration on managed clusters
3. Check GitOps Application sync once clusters are available
4. Validate end-to-end pipeline execution on provisioned clusters

**Result**: ‚úÖ **Installation health check SUCCESSFUL**. All infrastructure working, clusters provisioning normally.

## üîß PHASE 6: HCP NODEPOOL FIX

### Phase 6: HCP Cluster Node Provisioning - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
*Started: 2025-07-19 17:50*

**ISSUE DISCOVERED**: HCP cluster has control plane but no worker nodes

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- HCP generator was creating HostedCluster but missing NodePool resources
- HostedClusters need separate NodePool resources to provision worker nodes
- Existing cluster had `platform: type: None` but NodePool needed AWS platform

**Step 6.1**: Fix HCP generator to include NodePool - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Added NodePool generation to `generate_hcp_cluster()` function  
- NodePool configured with: nodeCount, instanceType, autoRepair, upgradeType
- Added nodepool.yaml to kustomization.yaml resources

**Step 6.2**: Fix platform compatibility - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Updated HostedCluster generator: `platform.type: AWS` with region
- Updated NodePool generator: `platform.type: AWS` with subnet filters
- Both resources now use consistent AWS platform configuration

**Step 6.3**: Test generator fixes - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Generated test HCP cluster with AWS platform
- Verified both HostedCluster and NodePool have matching AWS platform configs
- Confirmed ExternalSecrets still included correctly

### HCP Generator Status:
- ‚úÖ **HostedCluster**: AWS platform with region configuration
- ‚úÖ **NodePool**: AWS platform with instance type and subnet discovery
- ‚úÖ **ExternalSecrets**: Pull-secret for container registry access
- ‚úÖ **SSH Key Secret**: For node access
- ‚úÖ **KlusterletAddonConfig**: For ACM integration

**Result**: New HCP clusters generated with `bin/generate-cluster` will now include worker nodes via NodePool resources!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Consistency Issue Identified:

**Issue**: Existing HCP cluster `hcp-01-mturansk-test` has `platform.type: None` but should use `platform.type: AWS` for this AWS-based project.

**Root Cause**: Cluster was created before generator was fixed to use AWS platform consistently.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ **Generator Fixed**: New clusters will use AWS platform for both HostedCluster and NodePool
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Existing Cluster**: Still uses "None" platform (requires rebuild to change)

**Recommendation**: For production use, recreate existing HCP cluster with:
```bash
# Delete existing cluster
oc delete -k clusters/hcp-01-mturansk-test/

# Regenerate with fixed generator  
./bin/generate-cluster regions/us-east-1/hcp-01/

# Apply new AWS-platform cluster
oc apply -k clusters/hcp-01-mturansk-test/
```

**For Current Testing**: Existing cluster functional with "None" platform for control plane testing, but NodePool may not provision nodes without proper AWS infrastructure.

## üéØ PHASE 7: NEW HCP CLUSTER WITH AWS PLATFORM

### Phase 7: HCP Cluster AWS Platform Testing - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
*Started: 2025-07-19 17:55*

**Action**: Deleted old HCP cluster and generated new one with proper AWS platform configuration.

**Step 7.1**: Delete existing problematic cluster - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Deleted `hcp-01-mturansk-test` cluster with platform inconsistencies
- Cleaned up old cluster files

**Step 7.2**: Generate new HCP cluster - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- Created `hcp-02-mturansk-test` with consistent AWS platform
- Verified generator produces correct configurations:
  - HostedCluster: `platform.type: AWS` with region 
  - NodePool: `platform.type: AWS` with instanceType and subnet filters

**Step 7.3**: Fix service publishing strategies - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Fixed AWS platform compatibility issues in generator
- Updated services to use Route instead of NodePort for AWS platform:
  - OAuthServer: type: Route
  - Konnectivity: type: Route  
  - Ignition: type: Route
  - APIServer: type: LoadBalancer (compatible)

**Step 7.4**: Apply and verify new cluster - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Applied new cluster configuration successfully
- HostedCluster: STATUS=Partial (initializing normally)
- NodePool: Created and ready to provision AWS nodes
- ExternalSecret: STATUS=SecretSynced, Ready=True ‚úÖ

### New HCP Cluster Status:
- ‚úÖ **HostedCluster**: AWS platform with correct service publishing
- ‚úÖ **NodePool**: AWS platform with proper instance configuration
- ‚úÖ **ExternalSecrets**: Working pull-secret for container registry
- ‚úÖ **Platform Consistency**: Both resources use AWS platform

**Result**: New HCP cluster `hcp-02-mturansk-test` successfully deployed with consistent AWS platform configuration and proper NodePool for worker node provisioning!

## üßπ PHASE 8: CLEANUP STUCK CLUSTERS

### Phase 8: Remove Stuck EKS and OCP Clusters - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
*Started: 2025-07-19 18:05*

**Issue**: EKS and OCP clusters were stuck in provisioning state and needed cleanup.

**Step 8.1**: Delete ArgoCD ApplicationSets first - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Deleted `eks-01-mturansk-test-applications` ApplicationSet
- Deleted `ocp-01-mturansk-test-applications` ApplicationSet
- Prevents ArgoCD from managing clusters during deletion

**Step 8.2**: Delete cluster resources - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Deleted EKS cluster: `eks-01-mturansk-test` (CAPI resources)
- Deleted OCP cluster: `ocp-01-mturansk-test` (Hive resources)
- Cleaned up orphaned ManagedCluster resources

**Step 8.3**: Clean up configuration files - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Removed cluster configuration directories
- Removed deployment, operator, and pipeline configurations
- Removed GitOps ApplicationSet YAML files

### Current Environment Status:
- ‚úÖ **Active Cluster**: `hcp-02-mturansk-test` (AWS platform, initializing)
- ‚úÖ **Hub Cluster**: `local-cluster` (ACM hub, healthy)
- ‚úÖ **Legacy Clusters**: `cluster-10`, `cluster-40` (old naming, can be cleaned up later)
- üßπ **Cleaned**: All stuck EKS and OCP test cluster resources removed

**Result**: Environment cleaned up, ready for recreating fresh EKS and OCP clusters with corrected generators when needed.
