# Plugin Implementation Decisions

This directory contains plugin implementation decision documents for the bootstrap of platforms across different cloud providers and deployment scenarios.

## Structure

- **`common/`** - Cross-platform decisions that apply to all cloud providers
- **`aws/`** - AWS-specific decisions (OpenShift Container Platform, EKS, etc.)
- **`gcp/`** - Google Cloud Platform-specific decisions (GKE, etc.)
- **`oracle/`** - Oracle Cloud-specific decisions
- **`template.md`** - Template for creating new architecture decisions

## Cross-Platform Considerations

When making platform-specific decisions, consider:

1. **Common Patterns**: Many architectural patterns (GitOps, monitoring, security) apply across platforms
2. **Platform Differences**: Cloud-specific services and capabilities may require different approaches
3. **Migration Paths**: Consider how decisions in one platform might inform or differ from others
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in approach where possible while leveraging platform-specific strengths

## Decision Lifecycle

1. **Identify Need**: Determine if a decision is platform-specific or cross-platform
2. **Research Options**: Evaluate available solutions using the template
3. **Document Decision**: Use the template to document the decision and rationale
4. **Review**: Get stakeholder approval and cross-platform review if applicable
5. **Implement**: Execute the decision and track outcomes
6. **Review**: Periodically review decisions for relevance and effectiveness

## Platform-Specific Context

### AWS
- Primary focus on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)
- Integration with AWS services (Route53, IAM, etc.)
- Regional cluster deployment using MCE Hive or OCM

### GCP
- Primary focus on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Integration with GCP services (Cloud DNS, IAM, etc.)
- Regional cluster deployment using GKE multi-cluster patterns

### Oracle
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Kubernetes clusters
- Integration with OCI services
- Regional cluster deployment using OCI-specific patterns

## Contributing

When adding new decisions:

1. Use the `template.md` as a starting point
2. Place decisions in the appropriate platform directory
3. For cross-platform decisions, place in `common/`
4. Update this README if adding new platforms or major changes
5. Link related decisions across platforms where applicable
