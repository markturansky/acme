# Plugin Implementation Decision Template

This document provides a templated process for documenting and evaluating available options to implement a given piece of work as a plugin. Follow this structured evaluation to ensure transparency and alignment with Red Hat's strategic directions and open source best practices.

## Overview

**Plugin/Component Name:** _[Enter the name of the plugin or component being evaluated]_

**Description:** _[Provide a brief description of what this plugin/component will do]_

**Requirements:** _[List the key functional and non-functional requirements]_

**Evaluation Date:** _[Enter the date of this evaluation]_

**Evaluator(s):** _[List the names/roles of people conducting this evaluation]_

## Step 1: Reuse of Existing Code
**Priority: High**

Evaluate existing implementations from Application Interface or OSD Fleet Manager to maximize reuse and minimize duplication.

### Available Options:
_[Document any existing implementations found]_

### Assessment:
- **Suitability:** _[How well does the existing code meet the requirements?]_
- **Modification Required:** _[What changes would be needed to adapt the existing code?]_
- **Maintenance Considerations:** _[Who maintains the existing code? What are the update/support implications?]_
- **Support and Roadmap:** _[What support is available? What does the future roadmap look like?]_

### Decision:
☐ **Selected** - _[If selected, provide rationale]_
☐ **Not Suitable** - _[If not suitable, explain why]_

## Step 2: Red Hat Products or Promoted Open Source Alternatives
**Priority: High**

Evaluate Red Hat products or well-known open source projects (promoted or associated with Red Hat) that can fulfill the requirements.

### Available Options:
_[List Red Hat products or promoted open source alternatives identified]_

### Assessment:
- **Product/Project Name:** _[Name of the Red Hat product or open source project]_
- **Alignment with Requirements:** _[How well does this option meet the stated requirements?]_
- **Integration Complexity:** _[What would be required to integrate this solution?]_
- **Licensing Considerations:** _[Document any licensing implications]_
- **Support and Roadmap:** _[What support is available? What does the future roadmap look like?]_

### Decision:
☐ **Selected** - _[If selected, provide rationale]_
☐ **Not Suitable** - _[If not suitable, explain why]_

---

## Step 3: Upstream or Community Options
**Priority: Medium**

Consider new or emerging upstream or community-driven projects that align with Red Hat's and the broader open source community's current directions.

### Available Options:
_[List upstream or community projects identified]_

### Assessment:
- **Project Name:** _[Name of the upstream/community project]_
- **Maturity Level:** _[Assess the project's maturity, stability, and adoption]_
- **Community Health:** _[Evaluate the project's community size, activity, and governance]_
- **Technical Fit:** _[How well does this project align with technical requirements?]_
- **Strategic Alignment:** _[Does this align with Red Hat's and open source community directions?]_
- **Risk Assessment:** _[What are the risks of adopting this solution?]_

### Decision:
☐ **Selected** - _[If selected, provide rationale]_
☐ **Not Suitable** - _[If not suitable, explain why]_

---

## Step 4: Net New Build
**Priority: Lowest (Last Resort)**

Propose building a new component using modernized approaches consistent with Red Hat's and the open source community's evolving standards and practices.

### Justification:
_[Explain why options 1-3 were not viable and justify the need for a net new build]_

### Proposed Solution:
- **Architecture Overview:** _[High-level description of the proposed solution]_
- **Technology Stack:** _[Technologies, frameworks, and tools to be used]_
- **Development Approach:** _[Methodology, timeline, and resource requirements]_
- **Maintenance Plan:** _[Long-term maintenance and support strategy]_
- **Alignment with Standards:** _[How does this align with Red Hat's and open source standards?]_
- **Risk Assessment:** _[What are the risks of adopting this solution?]_

### Decision:
☐ **Selected** - _[If selected, provide detailed rationale and implementation plan]_
☐ **Not Suitable** - _[If not suitable, explain why]_

## Final Decision Summary

**Selected Option:** _[Clearly state which option was chosen: Step 1, 2, 3, or 4]_

**Final Rationale:** _[Provide a comprehensive explanation of why this option was selected over the others]_

**Next Steps:** _[Outline the next steps for implementation]_

**Stakeholder Approval:** _[Document any required approvals and their status]_

**Cross-Platform Impact:** _[Document any cross-platoform impact, for example RDS is present on all platforms the solution runs]_
